## What it is

Your AI agent is a strong generalist, but it doesn't know the *exact method* for a specific job — say, testing an API for access-control bugs. **SploitAgent is that missing know-how:** a binder of 159 short "how to do this one technique" pages the agent flips to when it needs one.

You describe the task in plain English → it picks the right page, runs it, proves the bug, and writes it up → and it never touches anything outside the scope you set.

| Word | What it means |
|---|---|
| **skill** | one Markdown file that teaches one technique |
| **workspace** | a folder for one target — holds your scope, notes, and findings |
| **scope** | the targets you're allowed to test — the hard boundary the agent won't cross |
| **console** | the optional local page (`sploit watch`) that shows what the agent is doing |

## Quickstart

> **Need:** an AI agent — [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), Codex, Gemini, or your own API script — plus `git` and a terminal. `python3` only for the optional console.

```console
# 1 · install once — links the skills into your agent + puts `sploit` on PATH
$ git clone https://github.com/NoorQureshi/SploitAgent && cd SploitAgent
$ ./sploit install

# 2 · make a workspace for your target (anywhere) and set the boundary
$ sploit new acme.com ~/work/acme
$ cd ~/work/acme
$ nano scope.txt                     # your authorized target(s) — nothing else gets touched

# 3 · (optional) watch the agent work, live, in your browser
$ sploit watch                       # runs in the background · stop: sploit watch --stop

# 4 · open your agent in the workspace and describe the task   ↓ (Claude Code / OpenCode below)
```

**How the pieces fit:** your **terminal** runs the agent; **`sploit watch`** shows its plan and live progress in your **browser**; everything lands in the **workspace folder** (`scope.txt · plan.md · notes.md · findings/`) — the source of truth, and what the console reads. Same flow with any agent; none of it is Claude-specific.

## Run it with your agent

Open your agent **inside the workspace** and describe the task in plain English — the matching skill loads itself.

<details open>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

```console
~/work/acme $ claude          # skills are already in ~/.claude/skills — auto-discovered everywhere

> Start an authorized assessment of acme.com. Confirm scope, then recon.

  ● tradecraft-scope-roe        loaded · scope confirmed (*.acme.tld)
  ● recon-subdomain-enum        14 hosts · api.acme.tld live
  ● api-bola                    testing object references on /api/v1/orders
      ✓ cross-tenant read confirmed with 2 accounts
  ✔ wrote findings/idor-orders.md
```

`./sploit install` linked the skills into `~/.claude/skills/`, so Claude Code finds them in **any** folder and loads the one that fits your request.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

```console
~/work/acme $ opencode        # launches the TUI in this folder, using your own model/API key

> Use the SploitAgent skills in ./skills. Start an authorized assessment of
  acme.com — confirm scope from scope.txt, then recon the attack surface.

  → reads AGENTS.md + ./skills · loads recon-* then routes by what it finds
```

No install step: OpenCode reads `AGENTS.md` and the `./skills` folder in the workspace automatically. (First time: `opencode auth login` to set your provider/API key.)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex · Gemini · any other agent / your own API script</b></summary>

```console
~/work/acme $ codex           # or: gemini  — run inside the workspace

> Use the SploitAgent skills here. Start an authorized assessment of acme.com,
  confirm scope from scope.txt, then recon.
```

Any agent works: point it at the workspace with read access to `AGENTS.md` and `./skills`, or paste a single `SKILL.md` into the chat for a one-off. Nothing to wire up.
</details>

## Watch it work — the console

`sploit watch` opens a small **read-only** dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8787` (in the background, so your terminal stays free). It just reads the workspace on disk, so it works the same whichever agent you run.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/activity.png" width="49%"
       alt="The live activity timeline: decisions, commands, results and findings as the agent works">
</p>

- **Attack Map** — the whole engagement as a decision graph: what was proved, ruled out, blocked, and skipped — and *why*.
- **Findings** — each confirmed issue rendered and ready to submit · **Activity** — a live, filterable timeline with the reasoning · **Plan / Notes** — the strategy and running log.

Under Claude Code a bundled hook records commands automatically, so the console fills in even if the agent doesn't log by hand.

## Ask it anything

| You type… | The agent loads |
|---|---|
| "recon acme.com and map the attack surface" | `recon-*` |
| "test this API for IDOR / BOLA (I'm authorized)" | `api-bola`, `web-idor` |
| "is this login's JWT forgeable?" | `web-auth-jwt` |
| "review ./src for injection bugs" | `code-review-*` |
| "I got a shell — what now?" | `privesc-enumeration` |
| "turn this finding into a report" | `reporting-*` |
| "write a Sigma rule to detect this" | `defense-detection-sigma` |

## Authorized use only

For security work you're **permitted** to do — a signed pentest scope, a bug-bounty program that lists the target, or systems you own. The first skill every engagement loads is `tradecraft-scope-roe`: it confirms authorization and refuses anything not in your `scope.txt`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report a vulnerability in SploitAgent itself.
