# Security Policy

SploitAgent is a library of **security skills for authorized testing**. This policy covers two
different things: reporting a vulnerability in SploitAgent's *own* code, and the rules for using it.

## Reporting a vulnerability in SploitAgent itself

If you find a security issue in the tooling in this repo — the `sploit` launcher, `install.sh`, the
`tools/console/` server, the `cc-activity-hook.py`, or `tools/catalog.py` (for example: the console
serving files outside a workspace, a path-traversal, or the installer clobbering files it shouldn't) —
please report it privately, not in a public issue:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability** (GitHub private advisory).
2. Describe the issue, the impact, and steps to reproduce.

We aim to acknowledge within a few days. Please give us a reasonable window to fix it before public
disclosure. There is no bounty, but we credit reporters who want it.

> Maintainers: enable **Settings → Code security → Private vulnerability reporting** so the button
> above appears.

### What is *not* a vulnerability here

The skills describe offensive techniques on purpose — that is the point of the library, not a flaw.
Reports that a `SKILL.md` "teaches hacking" are out of scope. The console binds to `127.0.0.1`, is
read-only, and never controls the agent by design.

## Using SploitAgent — authorized use only

SploitAgent runs real techniques against real systems. Use it **only** where you have explicit
authorization:

- a signed penetration-test scope / statement of work,
- a bug-bounty program whose policy lists the target as in scope, or
- systems you own.

Every engagement loads `tradecraft-scope-roe` first and is bound by the target's `scope.txt`. Do not
point it at anything you are not authorized to test. Using these techniques against systems without
permission is illegal in most jurisdictions.

## No warranty
