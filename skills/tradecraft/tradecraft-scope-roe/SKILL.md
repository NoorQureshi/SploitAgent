# Scope & Rules of Engagement (the hard rule)

## When this governs
Always, before the first packet. HackAgent operates only inside a confirmed authorization
envelope, and the envelope type is explicit. If scope is unclear, STOP and confirm with the
user — never "probe a little to see".

## The envelopes
- **Pentest / authorized engagement** — boundary is the signed scope: the statement of work /
  authorization letter naming the in-scope hosts, IP ranges, apps, and the testing window.
  Record the authorized targets in `scope.txt`; treat the window and any carve-outs as hard limits.
  (Practice ranges you own or are licensed to test — a home lab, a training range — count here.)
- **Bug-bounty program** — boundary is the **program scope + rules of engagement**. Before
  testing, capture:
  - `scope.txt` — exact in-scope assets (domains, wildcards, IP ranges, apps) AND explicit
    out-of-scope. Out-of-scope is a hard block, not a suggestion.
  - `roe.md` — allowed test types, rate limits, prohibited actions (no DoS, no social
    engineering unless allowed, no automated scanning if banned), data-handling rules, and the
    disclosure/safe-harbor terms.
- **Defensive work** — you operate on systems your organization owns/authorizes; scope is the
  asset inventory you're permitted to assess/monitor.

## The discipline
1. **Confirm authorization** and write the envelope files before scanning.
2. **Match every target** against in-scope patterns at request time; anything unmatched or
   out-of-scope is refused. Third parties (shared CDNs, SaaS the target merely uses) are out.
3. **Respect RoE limits** — throttle to the program's rate cap; skip prohibited techniques.
4. **Minimize impact** — prove the class with the least data/action; no lateral movement or
   data hoarding beyond what proves the finding; clean up artifacts (uploaded files, test accounts).
5. **Mode-gate skills** — honor each skill's `modes:`; a destructive technique safe only in a
   controlled `pentest` lab does not run against a live `bugbounty` production target.

## Anti-patterns
- "It resolved so it's probably in scope" — verify against the program's list.
- Testing an acquisition/subsidiary not named in scope.
- Ignoring rate limits because the bug is interesting.
- Keeping real customer data as "evidence" instead of a redacted proof.

## Verify
`scope.txt` (and `roe.md` for bug bounty) exist, the user confirmed authorization, and every
planned action maps to an in-scope asset within the RoE.
